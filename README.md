# Object Recognition in Office Environment using InceptionV3 (Pretrained Model)

This notebook demonstrates the application of InceptionV3, a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model available in Keras, to perform object recognition in the context of an office environment.

## Key Objectives:

1. **InceptionV3 Model**: Utilize the InceptionV3 model, pretrained on large-scale image datasets, for feature extraction and object recognition.

2. **Office Environment Dataset**: Employ a dataset comprising images from an office setting to evaluate the model's performance in recognizing objects commonly found in offices.

3. **Image Preprocessing**: Preprocess the input images to meet the requirements of the InceptionV3 model, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

4. **Prediction and Visualization**: Apply the pretrained InceptionV3 model to make predictions on the office images. Visualize the model's predictions and explore its accuracy.

5. **Fine-tuning (Optional)**: Optionally, explore fine-tuning the InceptionV3 model on the office dataset to improve its performance on the specific task.

This notebook aims to showcase the effectiveness of transfer learning using a pretrained InceptionV3 model for object recognition in a targeted environment. It provides insights into leveraging powerful, pretrained models for domain-specific tasks with minimal training effort.
